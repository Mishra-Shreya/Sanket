Introducing... **SANKET** - 
_**Speech to Indian Sign Language Translator**_

## Getting Started

**Sanket** is (currently) an _Android_ based _Indian Sign Langauge Mediator mobile app_ made using _Flutter_ and _Blender_. It is a virtual interpreter that translates Speech to Indian Sign Language (ISL) and helps to bridge the communication gap between people of the speaking community and the deaf & hard of hearing (DHH) community.

_This project's created as a part of school-pbl-activity._

... Project's still under development :wink: ...
